# Superliminal Bingo UI

This is a tracker UI for the game Superliminal. 

This works with [my other project](https://github.com/EtaoinWu/SLBingoCore) which actually obtains the data from the game's memory.

## Disclaimer

This is a piece of crap, bodged together in like six hours. I have no prior Vue or Electron experience. If this happens to work, thank god (whatever god you believe in is fine). 

## Usage

The [pdf](How to use the ugliest tracker overlay.pdf) file contains usage.
